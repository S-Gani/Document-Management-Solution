# Document-Management-Solution
The DMS handles CRUD operations, supports user shopping, admin controls, and runs on a secure server.
This README file provides a description of the CRUD operations for the Data Management System (DMS) and outlines the functionalities available for users and administrators.

**_Overview_**

1. User Shopping Experience:

- The website allows users to shop for products.
- Product data is fetched from a server running in the background.

2. Product Purchase:

- Users can purchase products in any desired quantity.

3. Admin Portal:

- Administrators can view all product details.
- Low stock alerts are available.
- Administrators can add and modify products directly from the portal.

**_Requirements_**
To ensure the proper functioning of the site, the following requirements must be met:

> Website Accessibility:

- The site must be accessible via a web browser.


> Server-Side Operations:

- The application must run on a server for security reasons.
- Browsers can read data locally but cannot write data. Therefore, a server is needed to enable two-way communication, ensuring data can be both read and written.
